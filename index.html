          <h2>Back to the Devlog with a Character Rework <time datetime="2023-11-03">2023.11.03</time></h2>
          <p>
            Well it has been just over a year since I stopped making actual
            posts. I fell off after just three entries, a new record. Well now I'm
            back. I was finding it much easier to just post stories on
            Instagram, but it feels too ephemeral now. I'd like to just have it
            all in one place. I have been regularly working on Scythe Machine,
            but since I don't have it in me to fill in a year's worth of
            updates, I'll just mention the most recent one.
          </p>
            <video autoplay loop muted playsinline src="./img/devlog/tree-runner-rework-video.mp4"></video>
            &nbsp;
          <p>
            I just reworked the green fellas because they were the first enemy I
            made over 2 years ago and the animations / control-scheme was out of
            date. Below is part of the new sprite sheet that I generated after
            exporting the 3d animations from Blender as a sequence of images
            which then get put together in Aseprite to make the actual sheet.
          </p>
          <video autoplay loop muted playsinline src="./img/devlog/tree-runner-3d-video.mp4"></video>

          <img loading="lazy" alt="" src="./img/devlog/spritesheet.jpg">
          &nbsp;
          <p>
            Then I pull that sprite sheet into Unity where it gets sliced up
            with every frame receiving a label of some sort. Afterwards, I
            personally use code to control the characters‚Äô animations every
            frame because the built-in animation tooling in Unity is kinda wack.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first gif at the beginning of this post shows the green fellas
            and their new animations / movement stuff. Excuse my poor aim in the
            clip,, I‚Äôm working on it üòµ‚Äçüí´

          <h2>Import New Artwork in B&W <time datetime="2022-10-23">2022.10.23</time></h2>
          <p>
            Today I messed with some of the lines from the new artwork and
            pulled it into the game to see how it looked. I haven't colored
            anything yet, I wanted to see what it would look like in black and
            white. While it does seem like it could possibly be worth exploring,
            it feels a bit more like a story book than a game, which isn't
            exactly what I'm going for. I think I'll spend some more time
            today/tomorrow adding color in a way that will let me change it in
            the game at runtime. Given that there will only be a few colors, my
            plan is to color in the artwork in photoshop in greyscale, and then
            write a shader in Unity that will map those greyscale color values
            to some color parameters that I can specify either in code or via
            the Unity UI.

          <h2>Giant Re-work and Rig <time datetime="2022-10-19">2022.10.19</time></h2>
          <p>
            I got some sick environment artwork done by <a
            href="https://www.instagram.com/snail.farm/">Jackson at Snail
            Farm</a> so I reworked the Giant character to match the artwork. The
            character has a weapon now, which I was hesitant to do at first
            because it complicates everything; the rigging, animating, in-game
            logic and effects are all harder to setup and deal with. But I do
            think it'll probably lead to a more interesting boss fight with more
            ways to create different kinds of attacks/obstacles. I just finished
            rigging the character with different weapon slots in Blender (i.e. I
            now have different ways of controlling the weapon/limbs of the
            character when animating) so I can finally get to the actual
            animations. For now, I'm going to just start off with getting the
            giant to stand up and walk around. Once that's in place, I plan on
            spending time to work with the artwork to try and figure out the
            best way to include it in the game. The first thing I'll try is to
            hand-paint a normal map on top of the artwork, bring it into the
            game, and get the lighting / colors to look good.

          <h2>Giant Attack Animation <time datetime="2022-10-05">2022.10.05</time></h2>
          <p>
            Started working on the giant's first attack animation. At first the
            thought was that he should dive the player(s) and cause a shockwave,
            so I animated that. Then I realized I had to animate the giant
            getting up and going back to idle somehow, but thought it felt kind
            of boring. So I ended the dive with the giant going into a headstand
            ready to start spinning into his next attack like a damn Beyblade.
            Let it rip baby.
